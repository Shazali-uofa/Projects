customer:

When the person enters a "new registration" it responds with coming soon and then send straight to NEW USER PAGE
upon successful registration the program terminates instead of displaying the customers table
for the login option the user should be able to pass through the id and password regardless of being a registered user or not
thank you gets displayed at wrong/unwanted time
upon a successful login the name displayed is the uid number but it should be retireved from either the customer or salesperson table
"Customer menu coming soon" is being displayed up successful login and right before the complete table being displayed
A small bug wherte if the program is already running and if I press the start button in the vscode, for some reason the code continues instead of restarting
entering the wrong product name terminates the entire program


26th OCT:

after a succesful login if I press enter or a wrong character it takes me back to the login page instead of having me to renter at the customer/salesperson page
-- I would say please try the new updated code I didnt see the issue in mine one which i updated latest.

salesperson:

a bug where after successfully entering the price it jumps to the keyword searched list
